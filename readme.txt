This is a simple app that lets you chat with OpenAI or Anthropic models via their API.

## New Python Backend

The app now includes a Python backend that calls the Anthropic API. The backend is built using Flask and handles chat requests to the Anthropic API.

## Hardcoded API Key

The server has a hardcoded API key for the Anthropic API.

## Messages API and Latest Model

The app uses the more up-to-date messages API in Anthropic instead of completions, and uses the latest model.
